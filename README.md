Hey there! I’m Arvind a student who’s deeply passionate about technology, people, and growth.

I believe tech isn’t just about coding it’s about solving real problems, building connections, and continuously learning to become a better version of yourself every day.

I’m currently exploring how AI, web development, Machine Learning can come together to make ideas come alive.

I love collaborating on projects that mix innovation with impact, and I’m always excited to learn from people who share the same drive for growth and curiosity.

When I’m not coding or editing, you’ll probably find me brainstorming ideas, studying human behavior, or just learning something new for fun.
